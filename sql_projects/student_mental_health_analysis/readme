# Student Mental Health Analysis – SQL Query

This project contains a SQL query designed to analyze student mental health data by examining different types of student stays and their corresponding average scores on various psychological assessments.

## 📊 Project Overview

The query focuses on students categorized as "Inter" in the `inter_dom` column (likely indicating international students). It summarizes:

- The count of students (`count_int`) for each `stay` category.
- The average scores (rounded to two decimals) for three mental health measures:
  - `todep` (possibly depression score)
  - `tosc` (possibly social connectedness score)
  - `toas` (possibly anxiety score)

The results are grouped by the type of `stay`, ordered in descending order, and limited to the top 9 categories.

## 🛠️ SQL Concepts Used

- `SELECT` with aggregation functions: `COUNT()`, `AVG()`, and `ROUND()`
- `WHERE` clause to filter records
- `GROUP BY` for aggregation by category
- `ORDER BY` and `LIMIT` to control result set size and order

## 📁 File Included

- `student_mental_health_analysis.sql` — Contains the SQL query described above.

## 📌 Notes

- The table analyzed is `students`.
- Only students with `inter_dom` equal to 'Inter' are considered.
- The query provides insight into how different types of student stay relate to average mental health scores.
